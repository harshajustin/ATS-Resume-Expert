https://github.com/harshajustin/ATS-Resume-Expert.git
cd ATS-Resume-Expert
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use a virtual environment to install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Application

## Running with Docker

You can also run the application in a Docker container, which makes it easier to deploy and share the environment.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the root directory:

```bash
docker build -t ats-resume-expert-container .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container, mapping port `8501` for Streamlit:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 ats-resume-expert-container
```

This will start the application inside a Docker container, and you can access it at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## Environment Variables

The application requires a Google Generative AI API key to function properly. Set the API key as an environment variable in a `.env` file.

### Example `.env` file:

```env
key=YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
```

Ensure that this file is placed in the root directory of the project, as the application loads this key using `dotenv`.
